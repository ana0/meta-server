  "historic_note": "Because this figure is not with its original packaging, it is difficult to determine exactly when it was produced and released to the public. The character Joe Cobb was one of the first members of the Our Gang kids, starring in the series between the years of 1923 and 1929. However, the other dolls which were released alongside the Joe Cobb doll by the Sayco Doll Corporation (Farina and Jean Darling) were based on characters whose collective roles only overlapped during the years 1927-1929. Therefore, it is most likely that this series of dolls was produced sometime between 1927 and 1929.",
